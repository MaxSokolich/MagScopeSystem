Bugs:
- no such cv2.cuda.inRange function for hsv thresholding. thus cuda does not work rn


To do:

- add ads1115 libraries for halleffect.py
- figure out how to run joystick without sudo

1) test 3D tracking, add Z position, improve z tracking, figure out blur with new hsv 
2) maybe get ps5 controller working
3) fix acoustic digitial potentiameter mapping
4) try and record video on seperate CPU/process
5) refactor custom tracker class by seperating out methods into seperate classes
        - algorthm/ control_trajectory


Notes:
- lots of continous aspects to this system. i.e functions that need to be external
enclosed in a while loop to work properlly. This results in a large amount of 
complexity:
        0) read commands from keyboard and mouse for GUI
        1) read frames from FLIR camera for tracking
        2) read commands from USB joystick for controlling
        3) read hall effect sensor magnetic field values for sensing

        4) output arduino signal array via UART/Serial
        5) output acoustic signal via RPi.GPIO
        6) TBD: output stepper motor signal via I2C
