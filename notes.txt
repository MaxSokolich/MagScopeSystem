Bugs:
- cv2.cuda.inRange function does not exist for hsv thresholding. thus cuda does not work rn
- still have sempahore leak on mac.

Notes:
- lots of continous aspects to this system. i.e functions that need to be external
enclosed in a while loop to work properlly. This results in a large amount of 
complexity:
        0) read commands from keyboard and mouse for GUI
        1) read frames from FLIR camera for tracking
        2) read commands from USB joystick for controlling
        3) read hall effect sensor magnetic field values for sensing

        4) output arduino signal array via UART/Serial
        5) output acoustic signal via RPi.GPIO
        6) TBD: output stepper motor signal via I2C
