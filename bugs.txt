Bugs:
1) maybe add function to toggle magentic field readings.
2) allow live adjustment of fps [SEMI COMPLETED]
3) fix scale bar and objective selecting
4) scale text and hud based on resize scale
5) test 3D tracking, add Z position
9) add amplifier curcuit
10) add simiulatneous joystick clicks
11) maybe get ps5 controller working







Notes:
- lots of continous aspects to this system. i.e functions that need to be external
enclosed in a while loop to work properlly. This results in a large amount of 
complexity:
        0) read commands from keyboard and mouse for GUI
        1) read frames from FLIR camera for tracking
        2) read commands from USB joystick for controlling
        3) read hall effect sensor magnetic field values for sensing

        4) output arduino signal array via UART/Serial
        5) output acoustic signal via RPi.GPIO
        6) TBD: output stepper motor signal via I2C
