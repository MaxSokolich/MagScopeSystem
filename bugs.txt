Bugs:
6) add color back to gui buttons
7) allow live adjustment of fps [SEMI COMPLETED]
9) fix scale bar and objective selecting
10) scale text and hud based on resize scale
11) remove redundant bot_loc initial_pos variabes
14) maybe make it so you can input an image of the microrobot for baseline bluring. Basically a zeroing aspect. 
15) test 3D tracking, add Z position
16) implment AcousticClass into gui
17) impliment hall effect class into gui
18)fix color camera


Components:
- add DDS module
- add hall effect sensors
- add motorized stage



BU:

path 1
- MPC
- RRT path planning
- bring the learning part into the picture 

path 2
- pattern formation in cells
- single robot cell manipulation


path 3
- multi agent
- generate different robots and characterize them
- determine reachability and adjust to determine optimal robot combination
