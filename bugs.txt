Bugs:
1) test 3D tracking, add Z position, improve z tracking, figure out blur
2) maybe get ps5 controller working
3) fix acoustic digitial potentiameter mapping
4) try and record video on seperate CPU/process
5) refactor custom tracker class by seperating out methods into seperate classes
        - algorthm/ control_trajectory
6) add color box next to hv thresholds
7)

sat:
- continue testing other videos and other hsv thresholds.
- make seperate slider for average size of microrobot
- nice job









Notes:
- lots of continous aspects to this system. i.e functions that need to be external
enclosed in a while loop to work properlly. This results in a large amount of 
complexity:
        0) read commands from keyboard and mouse for GUI
        1) read frames from FLIR camera for tracking
        2) read commands from USB joystick for controlling
        3) read hall effect sensor magnetic field values for sensing

        4) output arduino signal array via UART/Serial
        5) output acoustic signal via RPi.GPIO
        6) TBD: output stepper motor signal via I2C
